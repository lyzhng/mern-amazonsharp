# mern-amazonsharp
Clone of a clone as MERN exercise

## Purpose
*mern-amazonsharp* was created to mess around with the MERN stack, Webpack, and possibly TypeScript in the future. I worked on *Amazon#* in the past in a group project using Flask and SQLite3. Because of that, I wanted to try to do the same thing while exploring different technologies, and understanding "good"/"bad" practices â€“ all without time constraints. 

## Resources
*mern-amazonsharp* required a lot of googling. I learned from other people through blog posts, videos, etc.. I aimed to have a general overview of these practices without focusing entirely on it, as that would take away the exploration. If you would like to learn this way, here are some resources to get you started. The list is longer than this as I scoured the web whenever I encountered a bug, but these are what I vividly recall.
